## üìù Project Overview
- The goal of this project is to simulate train operations using clean OOP design.

## üîß Coding Guidelines
- Use object-oriented programming principles strictly.
- Follow PEP8 (for Python) / standard conventions for the language.
- Use descriptive class, method, and variable names.
- Add docstrings and inline comments for clarity, **in English**.

## ü§ñ Instructions for Codex
- Do **not** directly modify source files automatically.  
- Instead, **explain step by step how to make changes** so that I can edit the code myself.  
- Provide example snippets when useful, but keep them short and focused.  
- If multiple solutions exist, explain pros/cons briefly before recommending one.

## üåê Language & Learning Context
- I am a native Japanese speaker who is currently studying both English and programming.
- Please provide **all answers in English**.
- When possible, use beginner-friendly explanations and simple English.
- Focus not only on code but also on explaining programming concepts step by step.
